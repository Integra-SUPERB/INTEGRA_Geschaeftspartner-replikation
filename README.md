## Goal of this repository
Using the [Gesch채ftspartner Replikation Best채tigung](https://github.com/Integra-SUPERB/INTEGRA_Geschaeftspartner-replikation) repository, you can get information about the status of a new business partner. In Switzerland, both natural persons and juridical persons are considered business partners by the Swiss government. However, by using the [Gesch채ftspartner anlegen](https://github.com/Integra-SUPERB/INTEGRA_Geschaeftspartner-anlegen) API, you are not actually creating a new business partner directly. Instead, you are sending a request to a team at the Federal Finance Administration (FFA). This team manages the master data and ensures that every person only exists once in the database. If your request is approved, a new business partner will be created. To check the status of the business partner replication you can use this API.

## How does this API work?
Multiple links to the official sap documentation will help you understand the different parameters and necessary parts of information to use the API successfully. 

To provide a fast and easy reference, we recommend that you start by reviewing our [empty replication confirmation request XML file](https://github.com/Integra-SUPERB/INTEGRA_Geschaeftspartner-replikation/blob/main/BusinessPartnerSUITEBulkReplicateConfirmation_Out.xml). This file is intended to help you understand the structure and format of the request data that you need to provide in order to use the API.

The description for the replication of a business partner **inbound** is found here: [Replicate request in service.](https://api.sap.com/api/OP_BUSINESSPARTNERSUITEBULKREPLIC/resource)

The replication **outbound** is handled here: [Replicate request out service.](https://api.sap.com/api/OP_CO_MDG_BP_RPLCTRQ/resource)

If you want to learn more about the **success message** that the API should return after a successful replication, you can find detailed information in the [Replicate Confirmation](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/44e06f22436c43e582db6ccd5250e29b/f69dc6a7cd2f418f9ae309b2906f2c57.html?locale=en-US) document.
